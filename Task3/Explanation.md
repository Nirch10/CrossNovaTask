#Task 3 - Explanation

* The riddle asked us what are the minimum amount of sweets mario left the house with in total.

Answer : 424.

* We are told mario meets friends 4 times, the first time 4 than 5, 6 and in the last meeting he meets 7 friends.
* We are told each time he splits his sweets between the number of friends he meets at the time, but 1 sweets which he keeps for himself.

* For a case where mario did split all his sweets we need to find a common multiplier for all the groups counts (4*5*6*7)
therefore a possible answer could be 4*5*6*7 = 840 plus the 4 sweets he ate himself which will be a total of 844 sweets.
*this answer might be correct, but its not what we are looking for, as we look for the minimum amount of sweets.

*Now we can use the LCM (lowest common multiplier) to solve the question. 
=> the LCM of 4,5,6,7 is 420 
=> 420 + the 4 sweets mario ate is 424 which is the answer for the riddle.

(I added the algorithm in LcmCalc for a generic case and in order to solve the question)
