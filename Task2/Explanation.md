# Explanation Task 2

* This task asks to plot a graph

* Its x indexes are linearly increasing
* Its y indexes are increasing and decreasing withing a parabola

* The graph can be split to cycles - where on each cycle we can see a shape of a circle , when on every start of a cycle y increases a bit.

* Therefore, to solve this problem i created a list of x indexes which I kept increasing in a linear manner, 
  and y indexes which i increased and decreased as a parabola (x^2 equation).
  
*As I mentioned, the problem can be divided to small cycles and then combined to the graph we see, and that is exactly how i approached it.
from the picture I saw 10 cycles, so I initiated my cycle limit to 10.
then I changed the x's and y's amount of indexes and distance within each cycles based on math, and watching my results (which means it can be changed to plot more graphs like that)
